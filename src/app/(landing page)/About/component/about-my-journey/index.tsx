          <p className="mb-2 text-[16px] font-bold">
           Hi, I'm Awe Oluwadarsimi Grace, a passionate full-stack developer dedicated to building efficient and user-friendly web applications. I enjoy transforming ideas into clean, responsive designs that improve user interaction. My focus is on clarity, performance, and delivering value through technology.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-[16px] text-amber-500 font-bold">
            With expertise in both frontend and backend systems, I craft responsive UIs and strong server-side logic that work hand in hand. I aim to make every product intuitive and accessible, ensuring a seamless experience for all users. I believe great design and strong functionality should always complement each other
          </p>
          <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-4">
           Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked on several freelance projects, helping individuals and small businesses bring their digital ideas to life. Each project sharpened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of real-world development needs. Freelancing taught me adaptability, creativity, and collaboration.
